    <p>Nothing beats a classic homemade steak pie, complete with golden-brown flaky pastry and a rich beef filling. This easy family feast only takes 15 minutes to prep</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1kg braising steak, diced</li>
        <li>2 onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>2 beef stock cubes mixed with 600ml boiling water</li>
        <li>375g sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>

        <li>
            To make the filling, heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat half the oil in a large casserole dish, brown the meat really well in batches, then set aside. Add the onions adding a drizzle more oil, then cook on a low heat for 5 mins until coloured.

            Scatter over the flour, stirring until the flour turns brown. Tip the meat and any juices back into the pan along with the ketchup and give it all a good stir. Pour over the stock, season, and bring to a simmer then cover with a lid and put in the oven for about 2 hrs, until the meat is tender. The filling can be made up to three days ahead and chilled or frozen for up to three months.

            To make the pie, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the filling into a 24-26cm rimmed pie dish and brush the rim of the dish with some yolk. Unravel the pastry, drape over the dish and use a knife to trim and press the edges against the side of the dish. Re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration if you like. Brush the pie heavily with egg yolk. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie and bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave to stand for a few minutes before serving.
